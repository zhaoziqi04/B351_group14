# B351_project
This is a project of using neural network to play Mancala.
Our object is to train our neural networks on two different datasets generated by Alpha-beta pruning and Monte Carlo tree search (with alpha beta pruning feature in it).
Because tensorflow has so many different versions and typically they are incompatible with one another. So I strong recommend people to run our program on google colab: 
To run the game: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1R-5YqbldX9JY4Jtfhxq_DlyVyaRST45t
To train the neural network: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12-GQSKUpiKudUVuR7FCqmYE_vTx9ZWaQ
